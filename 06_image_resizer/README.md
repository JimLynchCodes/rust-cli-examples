# Image Resizer
Build a cli tool that resizes images!

<br/>

## Backstory
Imagine you want to have super optimized images for different screen sizes- large, crisp images for wide desktop screens; tiny, compact images for small screens, and various sizes in between.

Your designer finds it annoting to have to generate lots of different size images (and lets say the auto-generating function of his graphic design program doesn't give the quality or control we would like). So, it's up to you to build a cli tool that will take in an image and spit out that same image but in but different sizes. 

<br/>

## The Exercise
This cli tool should read in the image from the `input_image` folder.

The cli tool should then output 6 images in the `output_images` folder.

Three should be larger than the original. The first should be 2x the size of the original image, the second 4x, and the third 8x.

The other three images should be smaller than the original. The first should be half the size of the original, the second one fourth, an the third one eigth.

## Tests
It's up to you to decide how to unit test this code.

Create an integration test that compares the generated images to those in the `expected_output` directory.
