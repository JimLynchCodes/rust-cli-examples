# rust-cli-examples

Some Rust cli examples from Jim

### What is this repo?

-> Notes and sample rust files as I walk throught the Rust cli  docs [here](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html).

### Much Projects, Wow!

In order to encapsulate each little example as a separate project we have freely called `cargo new ___` to create many projects, each named in a way to describe the _new thing_ it introduces.
