# rust-cli-examples
Jim's solutions and tests to the [rust-cli-exercises](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes/rust-cli-exercises)!

<br/>

## What's Here?

This repo is a collection of many extremely small Rust projects.

This idea is to break down otherwise _scary_ Rust code into small, approachable, and easily testable little functions.

<br/>

## Running The Projects
Each folder in the root directory contains a completely independent Rust project meant to be run with `cargo`, which can be installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

First ensure you have rust and cargo installed:
```bash
cago --version
```

You can then navigate into each project folder and run the cli tool:
```
cargo run
```

You can also run the automated tests:
```
cargo test
```

_Note: This runs both unit tests and integration tests!_

In addition to running the tests, you can also check code coverage:
```
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

Then view the `tarpaulin-report.html` file in a browser.

You can also run _mutation tests_ to test your tests!
```
cargo mutate
```

<br/>

## How To Work Through The Examples
We recommend starting from the empty project in the [rust-cli-exercises](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes/rust-cli-exercises/tree/main) repo. The numbers prefixing each folder are meant to be a recommended path to following in exploring these projects, but feel free to jump around as they are completely independent of each other!

Each project has a README that explains the problem being solved and skills practiced.

<br/>

## Hints
If you get stuck and have the urge to go look at the example solution, wait! First take a peek at the Hint.md file in the project to see if that gets you past your blocker!

<br/>

## Solutions
If you really get stuck and want to see Jim's solutions, see the [rust-cli-examples](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes/rust-cli-examples) repo.

It is highly recommended to work through them on your own because by just reading the final code you are missing out on seeing all the compiler and linter errors along the way that led the code to end up this way...

<br/>

## Build Your Own _"Rust Toolbox"_
By building little Rust applications like these you are documenting how to accomplish and test different things you might want a command line utility to do.

If you starting building your own portfolio of Rust cli tools then one day when you _actually want to solve some business problem_ with Rust you won't be starting from scratch and can use some of your old code and/or experiences to help you!

## Why Rust For CLI Tools?

There are just a few reasons why Rust makes an excellent language for writing command line utilities:

- ### Fast Startup & Execution Time
    Often times there is a delay on startup and during heavy processing for languages with a garbage collector.
    
    Since Rust CLI programs do not have to boot up a vm or gc they can extremely fast, thus saving developer time, energy, and happiness in addition to company dollars!

- ### Low Level Control With A Nice Syntax
    
    The borrowing, lifetimes, and `mut` keyword gives the programmer very fine control over memory usage  

- ### Cargo Is Awesome

    Cargo makes it very easy to build and deploy cli tools, and not just to cargo- you can also publish your super efficient binary to other package managers like npm!

- ### Coding In Rust Is Fun!!
    
    Once you get the hang of it you may find that you actually really enjoy working on projects in Rust. There is a reason why it is voted the "Most Loved Programming Language" on the Stack Overflow survey every year!
