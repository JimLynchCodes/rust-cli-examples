# Github Scaffold
Build a cli tool that scaffolds a new project from files in a Github repository!

<br/>

## Backstory
Imagine you have some awesome new framework or starter project, and you want to make it super easy for other developers to scaffold your project in their local directory (something like create-react-app).

You decide to make a cli tool so users can easily scaffold out a new project with a single command!

<br/>

## The Exercise
This cli tool should clone a repository from Github into the "cloned_repos" directory (it's ok to hardcode the repository url into the code).

The cli tool should then delete the ".git" folder that is created when the repo is cloned.

<br/>

## Tests
It's up to you to decide how you would unit test this code.

Create an integration test that verifies that the repo was cloned and that the .git folder was deleted.
