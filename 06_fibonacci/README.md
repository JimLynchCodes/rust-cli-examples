# Fibonacci
Create a cli tool that prints a number from the fibonacci sequence!

<br/>

## Backstory
Imagine you want to know what the 100th element in the fibonacci sequence. What about the 1000th? You decide to craete a cli tool that will print this information.

_This project can serve as a proof-of-concept for any Rust code that needs to recursively call a function!_ 

<br/>

## The Exercise
The exercise is to write a cli tool that accepts a positive integer as an argument and returns the number at that index of the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence). 

<br/>

## Tests
It's up to you to decide how you would unit test this code.

Write some integration tests that verify that the console output contains the correct number from the fibonacci sequence based on the input integer.
